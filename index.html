         <p >I am a 23 year Navy veteran with a passion for finding and applying data-driven solutions to improve business outcomes.  Back story: I enlisted in the Navy in 1997 as a Submarine Communications Electronics Technician. After 16 years, I commissioned as a Communications Limited Duty Officer and Completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration.  I later transitioned to the Information Professional Corp and have been working on my MBA with an empahsis in Information Systems Management. I am a life-long learner, and started my journey to become a self-taught computer programmer earlier this year due to COVID-19 requiring most of the country to isolate at home.</p>
